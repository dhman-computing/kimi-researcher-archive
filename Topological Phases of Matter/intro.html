                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Topological phases of matter represent a revolutionary paradigm in condensed matter physics, moving beyond the traditional Landau theory of phase transitions, which classifies phases based on symmetry breaking. Instead, topological phases are characterized by global properties of their electronic wavefunctions that are robust against local perturbations, such as disorder or interactions, as long as certain symmetries are preserved. This robustness arises from the non-trivial topology of the underlying band structure.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The concept of topology, a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, finds a profound application here. For instance, a donut (torus) and a coffee cup are topologically equivalent because one can be continuously deformed into the other without tearing or gluing, both having one "hole." A sphere, having no holes, is topologically distinct. In condensed matter, these "holes" or topological invariants manifest as quantized physical observables, such as the Hall conductance.

            <!-- Topological Insulators (TI) -->
            <section id="topological-insulators" class="section-card p-6 mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">2. Topological Insulators (TIs)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Topological Insulators are materials that behave as electrical insulators in their bulk but conduct electricity along their surfaces or edges. This fascinating property arises from a non-trivial topology of their electronic band structure, protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    In 3D TIs, the bulk is gapped, but the surface hosts gapless Dirac fermions. These surface states are spin-momentum locked, meaning the spin of an electron is locked perpendicular to its momentum. This unique spin texture prevents backscattering, making these states highly robust against disorder. The topological invariant characterizing 3D TIs is often related to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Hamiltonian for a simple 3D TI model can be described by:
                    $$ H(\mathbf{k}) = \epsilon_0(\mathbf{k}) I + \sum_{i=x,y,z} v_i k_i \sigma_i + m(\mathbf{k}) \sigma_z $$
                    where $\epsilon_0(\mathbf{k})$ is a trivial energy term, $v_i$ are Fermi velocities, $\sigma_i$ are Pauli matrices representing spin, and $m(\mathbf{k}) = m_0 - B(k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)$ is a momentum-dependent mass term. A topological phase transition occurs when $m_0$ changes sign, leading to band inversion.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Examples of 3D TIs include bismuth chalcogenides like $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$, $\text{Bi}_2\text{Te}_3$, and $\text{Sb}_2\text{Te}_3$. These materials have been extensively studied experimentally, confirming the existence of their unique surface states through techniques like ARPES (Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy).

            <!-- Quantum Spin Hall Effect (QSHE) - Extended Content -->
            <section id="qshe" class="section-card p-6 mb-8">
                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">3. Quantum Spin Hall Effect (QSHE)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) effect is a two-dimensional topological phase of matter, serving as the first experimentally realized topological insulator. Unlike the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE), which requires a strong magnetic field and breaks time-reversal symmetry, the QSHE occurs in the absence of a magnetic field and is protected by time-reversal symmetry.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    In a QSH insulator, the bulk is insulating, but its edges host a pair of counter-propagating, spin-polarized helical edge states. This means that electrons with spin up propagate in one direction along the edge, while electrons with spin down propagate in the opposite direction. Crucially, these edge states are "helical" because their spin is locked to their momentum, preventing elastic backscattering in the absence of magnetic impurities or time-reversal symmetry breaking.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The QSHE can be understood as two copies of the integer Quantum Hall effect, one for spin-up electrons and one for spin-down electrons, with opposite Chern numbers. The total charge Hall conductance is zero, but there is a quantized spin Hall conductance.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The theoretical prediction of the QSHE was made for graphene with strong spin-orbit coupling, but the effect was later predicted and experimentally observed in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. The critical ingredient is a band inversion driven by strong spin-orbit coupling, where the order of conduction and valence bands is inverted at certain points in the Brillouin zone.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The edge states of a QSH insulator are described by a 1D Dirac equation:
                    $$ H_{\text{edge}} = v_F (\sigma_x k_y - \sigma_y k_x) $$
                    where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $\sigma_x, \sigma_y$ are Pauli matrices representing spin. This Hamiltonian describes massless Dirac fermions, leading to the robust, gapless edge modes. The robustness of these edge states makes QSH insulators promising candidates for dissipationless spin transport and future spintronic devices.

                <h2 class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-4">4. Topological Superconductors (TSCs)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Topological Superconductors are materials that possess a bulk superconducting gap but host protected, gapless excitations at their boundaries. These boundary excitations are of particular interest because they are Majorana fermions, which are their own antiparticles.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Majorana fermions in TSCs are non-Abelian anyons, meaning that braiding them around each other results in a non-trivial change in the quantum state of the system. This property makes them highly attractive for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing, as information encoded in their non-local correlations is robust against local decoherence.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The simplest theoretical model for a 1D topological superconductor is the Kitaev chain. This model predicts the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the ends of the chain when certain parameters are met.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Experimental efforts to realize TSCs and detect Majorana zero modes are ongoing, with promising candidates including:
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 text-gray-700">
                        <li>Semiconductor nanowires with strong spin-orbit coupling in proximity to a conventional superconductor and under an external magnetic field.</li>
                        <li>Topological insulator-superconductor heterostructures.</li>
                        <li>Iron-based superconductors and chiral $p$-wave superconductors like $\text{Sr}_2\text{RuO}_4$.</li>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The detection of Majorana zero modes typically involves observing a zero-bias peak in tunneling conductance measurements, though definitive proof of their non-Abelian statistics remains a significant experimental challenge.

                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Weyl and Dirac semimetals are topological states of matter that represent intermediate phases between insulators and metals. Unlike TIs, which have a bulk gap, these materials possess protected band touching points (nodes) in their bulk Brillouin zone.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Dirac Semimetals:</strong> In 3D Dirac semimetals, the conduction and valence bands touch at discrete points in momentum space, forming four-fold degenerate Dirac nodes. These nodes are protected by crystal symmetries and time-reversal symmetry. Examples include $\text{Na}_3\text{Bi}$ and $\text{Cd}_3\text{As}_2$. They can be thought of as 3D analogues of graphene.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Weyl Semimetals:</strong> Weyl semimetals are characterized by pairs of two-fold degenerate Weyl nodes in their bulk, which act as sources and sinks of Berry curvature. Each Weyl node has a definite chirality (either +1 or -1), and they always appear in pairs of opposite chirality. Unlike Dirac nodes, Weyl nodes are robust even in the absence of time-reversal or inversion symmetry.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    A key signature of Weyl semimetals is the presence of "Fermi arcs" on their surfaces. These are open arc-like surface states that connect the projections of Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities on the surface Brillouin zone. This is a direct manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in these systems.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    The low-energy Hamiltonian near a Weyl node can be approximated by:
                    $$ H_{\text{Weyl}}(\mathbf{k}) = \chi v_x k_x \sigma_x + v_y k_y \sigma_y + v_z k_z \sigma_z $$
                    where $\chi = \pm 1$ is the chirality of the Weyl node, and $v_i$ are anisotropic Fermi velocities. Examples of Weyl semimetals include TaAs and NbAs. These materials exhibit fascinating transport phenomena, such as the chiral anomaly, leading to negative magnetoresistance.
